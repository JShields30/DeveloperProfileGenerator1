#User Story
I wanted to be able to instantly generate developer profiles to provide information to clients.

#Overview

This node program pulls all of the users Github profile information and generates it to a pdf when prompted in terminal. To get this program to run users run the file via node command in terminal. Once the file initializes, the user fills in their github user name, and chooses a predetermined color scheme. Once they choose their color a pdf is generated with the users information in the color scheme that they chose.  

#The PDF that is generated contains:
Github profile image 
Github username 
Github user bio 
Github public repositories, stars, users, followers, and users following 

Links to users Github profile, blog, and location via google maps 

#NPM packages used:
electron
electron-html-to
axios
cb
dotenv
inquirer
