*User Story

This node program pulls all of the users Github profile information and generates it to a pdf when prompted in terminal. To get this program to run users run the file via node command in terminal. Once the file initializes, the user fills in their github user name, and chooses a predetermined color scheme. Once they choose their color a pdf is generated with the users information in the color scheme that they chose.  

*The pdf generated includes users location, the users Github page, users blog, pulic repositories, followers, following, and Github Stars.*
